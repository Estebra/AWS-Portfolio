# My AWS Practice Portfolio

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a cloud enthusiast who recently earned the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certification. This repository is dedicated to documenting and showcasing the various hands-on executions and projects I'm undertaking to deepen my understanding and improve my skills on the AWS platform.

Here you'll find a collection of my experiments with different AWS services and configurations, ranging from basic deployments to more advanced scenarios. While my long-term goal is to specialize in **cloud security**, my current focus is on gaining a solid foundation and broader experience across the general cloud environment.

I invite you to explore the different folders and discover the projects I've been working on!
